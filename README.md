# ENTERTAINMENT BASED TOY (Elephant)
A toy manufacturing industry in the town is interested in designing of toys for entertaining the kids. There is need of designing an elephant model which should be semi-automatic, should move as slow as possible, and serve the purpose of 
entertainment and attract kids with its appearance. The cost of the toy should be less than 2500.and it should move as slow as possible.
The remote control basically consists of two types, one is the wired and another one is the wireless. The wired component consists of remote control which can easily control the movements and the wireless component consists of receiving and detecting sensors and performing actions accordingly. My project is specially for the small children’s, so that they can play . This smart toy performs walking movement. The goal of this project is to design a toy elephant  for  entertainment.

<br/>Main objectives of this project are:
<br/>➢ The toy should move as slow as possible.
<br/>➢ As this toy is for children (3-6 years) it should be easy to operate.
<br/>➢ Appearance of the toy should be good, then only children likes it to play
<br/>➢ Cost of the toy should not exceed 2500Rs.
<br/>➢ Body of the toy should be much rigid.

Firstly, a code with required operations including ultrasonic sensor and Bluetooth module with switch operation is uploaded into micro-controller (Arduino).
L293D Motor driver shield is attached to Arduino board and wheels using shafts are attached to the motor driver using wires. 
Bluetooth module sent the signal to the Arduino board and wheels starts rotating. Hence the elephant toy starts moving.
We can operate it manually by using ultra sonic sensor. 
Ultra sonic sensor is kept at the front of the toy. If ultrasonic sensor detects any object (obstacle) then it will change toy’s direction.
